Tool Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Motivation:
I used ChatGPT to help debug Docker container networking issues, fix Flask code for Service1, and structure the exercise report.

How it helped:
- Provided step-by-step guidance for Docker Compose setup.
- Suggested corrections for using service names (`service2`, `storage`) instead of `localhost`.
- Helped in formatting persistent storage logs and ensuring they matched across services.
- Assisted in writing and formatting the final report (Report.md).

Limitations:
- Could not directly run or test Docker commands; I had to execute and verify them myself.
- Some adjustments were needed for macOS-specific paths.
- Advice on report formatting sometimes required refinement.

Missed/Incomplete:
- Did not initially provide the exact report structure required; I had to adjust sections later.
- Mermaid diagrams and markdown formatting required manual verification in VS Code.

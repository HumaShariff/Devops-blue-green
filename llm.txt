#### Used LLM Tool
ChatGPT (GPT-5) was used during the completion of this assignment.

### Reason to Use LLM
The motivation to use ChatGPT was to understand and troubleshoot GitLab CI/CD pipeline issues related to Docker, Harbor delivery, and deploying the microservices to a VM. 
I used the model mainly as a learning companion to clarify errors, understand configuration logic, and structure the deployment scripts.

#### How and Why LLM Helped
ChatGPT provided guidance in multiple areas:

1. CI/CD Troubleshooting:**
   - Suggested proper configuration for the `docker:dind` service and `DOCKER_HOST` setup.
   - Explained how to structure multi-line SSH commands inside GitLab CI scripts safely.
   - Helped ensure that Docker build, push to Harbor, and deploy stages worked correctly.

2. Concept Clarification:**
   - Explained the difference between `docker-compose` vs `docker compose` and how to pull images from Harbor on the VM.
   - Clarified the usage of GitLab CI/CD variables for Harbor credentials and SSH private key.
   - Helped me understand why persistent storage and `vStorage` were removed in this exercise and how Service1 interacts with the Storage service.

#### Mistakes Made by LLM
- Initially suggested SSH commands and YAML structures that caused parsing errors due to improper quoting and escaping.
- Proposed environment variable settings (`DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR`) that were not required in the course runners and caused temporary build failures.
- Suggested some commands without `sudo`, which caused permission errors on the VM.

#### What the LLM Could Not Provide
- It could not see or access my GitLab repository, pipeline logs, or the actual VM environment in real time.
- It could not verify if Harbor authentication worked correctly — this required manual debugging.
- It could not know which images or dependencies were preinstalled in the course’s GitLab runners, so some commands had to be adjusted through trial and error.
- It could not perform live tests of network/firewall configurations on the VM — I had to verify access to port 8199 manually.
